KIM: Previously, on
"The Kardashians"...

You know how I feel about you,
and I wanna get us back together,

and hopefully, be able to expand
our family one day, God willing.

Trust takes time.

♪ I'm on top ♪

Not yet.
[laughs]

I have always taught my kids
since they were born

that family comes first.

KHLOÉ:
Oh my goodness!

I am so excited
because today True and I

get to move into our new dream home.

Tristan is gonna be moving in with us.

[♪]

Khloé threw him his 30th birthday.

He went to Houston to play on the road,
and then slept with this girl.

♪ You're gonna fear me ♪

[♪]

Like, we have no
[bleep] idea if she knows.

She's not responding.

I sent it to her, and I said, "Call me."

Oh, this is her.
I'll call you right back.

Hi.
KHLOÉ [on phone]: Hi.

- Did you see what I sent you?
- No. Hang on.

What?! What the [bleep] is this?

- So, he's been lying to you.
- What?!

- Did you know about this?
- No!

What the [bleep]. Oh my god.
This cannot be happening.

- Well, he did a full declaration.
- And what does that even mean?

- So, basically, she sued him, and his attorneys...
- What?!

Went on record with a full declaration
from him, giving a statement.

Probably never thought it would be leaked.

And the court papers say,
you know, "I, Tristan Thompson.

"I met her in Houston
after my 30th birthday party.

"Only time I had
sexual intercourse with petitioner,"

which is the girl,
"was in March 2021 in Houston, Texas."

- This is from his words in his declaration.
- Kim!

So, I text it to him, and I'm like,
"Does Khloé know about this?"

Oh my god. Can you text this to me?
I need to [bleep] see the screens hot.

Yep.

He's not responding to me.
He's probably shaking.

Let me [bleep] call him.
I can't [bleep] believe this.

But if this isn't the biggest sign

for you to not have another baby
with this human being.

Well, I just would like the truth.

KIM:
When someone hurts someone that you love,

you get protective.

And my heart is breaking for Khloé

because I know that she was really trying,
and I know that he was really trying.

And then this happens,
and it's like, "Dude, what the [bleep]?"

[Khloé crying]

Everything's gonna be okay.

No matter what,
everything's gonna be okay.

You know, we really believed
that he had changed.

Like, I was his biggest supporter.

It's noth... If...
But if this isn't more clear,

the most clear situation,
I don't know what is.

[Khloé sobbing]
Huh?

I think we need to have a family meeting.

Oh my god.

- Okay.

Every time there's some
serious family drama going on,

we always have a family meeting,

and we all lean on each other for support,

and that's what we're here for.

Khloé. She's the strongest girl I know,

but sometimes,
the strongest girl you know

isn't so strong all the time,

and I don't want her to get
to a place where she, you know,

doesn't have anybody to talk to

because she feels like
she has to be strong.

She keeps recovering, forgiving, you know,

for the sake of her daughter.

- COREY GAMBLE: Yeah.
- You know?

- Is she coming?
- Doesn't look like she is.

She probably don't feel like
talking about the negative stuff.

I'm sure she feels
devastated and humiliated.

Here she was...
You know, this all happened

around Tristan's birthday
when we were all celebrating.

She don't look bad.

The person that's making
the mistakes look bad.

I mean, Khloé's great, yeah.
KRIS: Well, of course, but...

Khloé just text me that
she's not gonna come.

♪ Melancholy music playing ♪

So.
KRIS: I wish she would've shown up.

I think the longer it goes on
without really expressing her feelings,

and deciding how she wants to move forward

can be very alienating and lonely.

You know, she tends
to keep everything inside.

Yeah.

The lack of honesty
is what does it for me,

is, like, let's just be honest
with who we are, and what we're doing,

and the mistakes we're making

because it's way less
hurtful to say the truth

than to, like, find out on the internet,
and not feel like you're in the loop.

KRIS:
But it's such a lack of respect.

This is somebody who's got
a pattern of bad behavior.

Somebody that has lied to her since June.

To go through a whole declaration,
and to be deposed...

And to hire attorneys,
and go through all the

- last six months that he's had.
- Soon as there was trouble, he should've...

- KRIS: Nine months.
- Went to Khloé.

- And he should've went to Khloé...
- Yes.

- COREY: Soon as there was information, before lawyers.
- 1,000%.

Should've went to Khloé.

This is not something
that can be undone.

And if he's in this pattern,

why does she have to just keep suffering?

That's what breaks my heart.

We've given Tristan so many
opportunities and chances

to work on himself,
and treat my sister the way

that she deserves to be treated.

I just feel super disappointed.

There's all these people,
like, who blame Khloé.

That really gets me, too.

Like, they make it look like
the girl is, like, a loser,

or unable to not be cheated on,
or she deserves it.

Like, who gives a [bleep] what
other people think. KIM: Totally.

I prefer to take the high road,
and be a good person,

and who we are,
is we're people that would actually

get Tristan help.

- That's who we are.
- But to say that I'm not tempted sometimes,

I'd be lying.

I'm exhausted of taking the high road.

I mean, I'm on my zone where I'm like,

if you bring bad energy in my life,
like, a boundary goes up.

Half of me wants to just put it on blast.

If you don't think I screens hot
every single [bleep] thing.

KRIS:
That's my girl.

I'm just not in the mood today,
so I don't know.

- But, you know, I don't know.
- [laughs] She's not in the mood.

And then I think from the wise words
of the great Michelle Obama,

"When they go low, you go high."
KOURTNEY: Yeah.

- And that's what we always do.
- Always do.

I think it's hard for anybody
to go through a divorce or a separation,

but it's much more magnified,
and it's much more emotional and scary

when you're doing it
in front of the whole world.

All I wanna know is if Khloé's
gonna make it to the... photo shoot

for... Kardashians show.

Khloé thrives on being busy

- in these moment...
- She's a workaholic.

- Distraction.
- Well, it's a distraction.

[chamber humming]

KENDALL:
For the past couple years,

I've been, like, really just, like...
loving health.

I don't know. It's become an obsession.

I am a major hypochondriac.
I think of everything.

It's always Doomsday.

Everyone, all my friends make fun of me.

I have this whole new room in my house

that's all these crazy gadgets and gizmos,

like massive machines that I get into,

say I just love taking care of my body.

It's, It's honestly,
kind of, embarrassing.

It's, like, crazy.

But I also think
I'm a little obsessed to the point

where it could become unhealthy,
ironically enough.

I usually stay in for, like,
an hour or more,

so I was answering emails,
and then I was watching a Netflix show.

Sure, I...
I was watching a Hulu show.

[chuckles]

KENDALL:
I found out about Tristan

through our family group chat.

It is a... You're in, You're in,
a little bit of a state of shock

of just like, "How does someone
do this so many times over?"

That's like...

I, I would wanna know before,
I guess, the internet, um, told me, but.

Hey, I was just calling
to check in on you.

Um, have you guys spoken?

KHLOÉ [on phone]:
Um, no.

I guess he had court today or something,

so he just sends me, like, updates,
but I don't respond.

I'm not sure that there's one thing
that hurts more than the other

in a situation like this.

Everything is an act of betrayal.

Everything is a lie.

Everything is manipulation. It's deceit.

Did Tristan have every
opportunity to tell me? Yes.

Was Tristan going to tell me
if there wasn't a baby involved?

Absolutely not, and that shows
a lot about his character.

The entire thing is despicable.

I don't think he... thinks that any
of these declarations are gonna be public

'cause they were supposed
to be court-sealed.

He's been dealing
with this very stressful situation,

and lying, and not telling anyone.

That's even more insane to me.
Like, you didn't even tell your friends.

- You didn't tell anyone. Like...
- That's what I keep telling...

I'll go, "If you cheated,
and, like, admitted that,

"I would respect you a little more.

"You cheated, lied,
and were hiding it for months

thinking I would never know?"

- Yeah.
- Like, so you know what that tells me?

- There's a dozen other...
- Yeah, right.

Situations that just haven't outed him.

Yeah. Obviously, no one's
judging you or anything. I just...

Of course not.

The trolls are just mean,
and they have no idea.

Have you been feeling anxious lately

'cause I know that when
I go through... wild situations,

I get really, really, like,
anxious, and restless, and...

I'm so anxious.

I've been really dehydrated,
I fainted the other day...

What?!

Khloé, h-how do you...
When, When did you faint?

[Khloé sighs]

Are you...
Like, why didn't I hear about this?

I'm finding, like,

sometimes I feel
like I'm having literally...

Like I can't breathe,
and I'm gasping for air.

- And I just fainted, but I...
- Were you by yourself?

KHLOÉ: There's so much
stress. There's so much noise.

It's become such...
either clickbait or a media story.

I see that all the time that
I should've known better,

I knew what I was doing, no one feels bad.

It's really sensitive.
I feel incredibly let down.

[on phone] But I'm fine. I've been
put on a... some beta-blockers,

and I'm gonna block all
the sh*t out of my system,

and everyone can [bleep] off.

Perfect.
Scream into a pillow or something.

Sometimes that helps.

Cry in the shower,
and no one will know the difference.

No, but that makes me sad
that you're... struggling.

I just think that there's, like,
brighter things for you in the future.

It's just gonna feel so good.

I'm not even thinking
about that right now.

I would rather, like, bleed out slowly.
[chuckles]

Oh my god.

You know, sometimes, you do
stupid things for your kids,

but also, you can't be stupid
for your kids for so long.

Of course not,

but you also have to respect your...

You have to respect yourself
at the end of the day,

and, like, you can only
do so much, you know?

Totally, but I will say I'm really proud

- for how I tried for True...
- I am, too.

There's nothing that can be said
or done that will make me feel better.

All of the work, the energy,
the conversations,

all of those bricks that
we were laying down this foundation,

all for it to just,
like a tornado, go through,

and everything just be... demolished.

Well, I'm sorry you're
dealing with all of this.

I feel really bad.
It's just, like, no one deserves this.

Thank you. No, it, it sucks,

- but thank god I have you guys, and...
- Yeah.

All right, well, I love you,
and call me whenevs.

- I love you, too.
- Okay, bye.

[call ends]

It's, like, hard to even believe
that this is, like, tru... real.

I mean, I just feel really bad for her.

Like... I mean, it makes me so angry,

especially because he fooled,
obviously, Khloé,

but the rest of us, too,

and, like... I really did
think he had changed.

Like, anyone who would ever,
like, criticize, or talk about him,

I would always be like, "No, no, no."
Like, "He changed."

Like, I would have his back,

and... it's almost like, in a way,
he, like, you know, betrayed us all.

KIM: I think everyone
thinks that Khloé's so strong

that she can handle it all,
but I know that she's not,

and you're gonna break down at some point.

She feels inside so numb to the situation,

but it makes me sad 'cause I feel like
she's at home, like, crying about it,

and she doesn't want any
of us to see that she's sad.

And that's what makes me
get protective over her,

and wanna check on her.

Like, I don't know if I should,
like, unfollow Tristan again.

I don't wanna play that game,
like, publicly.

- And that's always how I feel.
- And then sometimes, I'm just like,

I want to also cleanse my palate,

and when is that time when we,
like, step into our siblings' lives,

and be like, "Okay, this isn't okay."

I feel like we always tiptoe
around each other's situations

'cause we just don't wanna meddle.

And I respect that no one came to me
during my marriage, and was like,

"Are you good?"

Everyone let me have my own journey,
and see that on my own,

and I appreciate that,

but sometimes, I, like,
look back, and I'm like,

"When do we jump in?"

Like, I just...
That's what I'm so unclear about

- is, like, when...
- Well, now there's nothing to jump in on.

Like, now it is what it is.

What I have... frustrations about,

and it has nothing to do
with any of you guys,

it's just, like, it wasn't the first...
Wasn't the first or second mistake.

I'm just exhausted.
I'm exhausted of dealing with everything,

so people might think
my approach is... crazy or weird,

and I'm definitely numb and all that,

but I'm also just...

I've done this so many times now.
It's like... It's humiliating.

And what...
Like, there are no more tears left to cry.

That's the time that I wish someone
would've been like, "No."

- Yeah.
- "What do you mean?

"We've done this how many times?
No, you're not crazy.

Actually, you're [bleep] right."

- Like...
- But if people knew what, what

my relationship really was like,

I think they would be like,

- "How did this last this long?"
- Yeah.

But I can live with myself
knowing that I tried

- everything humanly possible...
- Yeah.

To make a situation work,
and so, I could walk away...

- 100%. No, but guilt-free.
- ...being, like, absolutely guilt-free.

- Guilt-free.
- And I feel like you could at least say,

you had a family,
you tried everything in your might,

and you can look
your daughter in the face,

- and say that, and then, you know?
- I know all that.

And I don't have any regret about that.

And it's the same thing
how I felt about Lamar.

Like, I gave it my all.
I've never felt guilty.

Same thing with Tristan.
I don't feel guilty.

Like, I believe in second, third,
fourth chances of everyone.

I want you to have that.
Me... I want me.

I want someone to give me
the same grace I'm giving them.

Totally.

It's time to walk away,
and I don't feel guilty about it.

I tried so hard.

I'm fine.

Is it the most [bleep] up thing

that this has to happen so publicly
every [bleep] time in my life? Yes.

Is it so [bleep] up that society
blames me or women?

It's... disgusting,
and, like, deplorable of these people

to talk about other people like that.

Like, there's no empathy,
there's no compassion.

There's just no sense of humanity.

Like...

- I get it.
- If...

You know what?
All of you [bleep] trolls on the internet,

that make Khloé feel like
the biggest piece of sh*t,

I will find each and every one of you,

and... not threaten you on  TV,
but I... It's wrong.

Like, it's so wrong

because you guys don't understand
that when you have a child,

you'll do anything to try to make it work,

and I'm so proud of who Khloé is

that she wanted to give
her relationship a second chance

even after he dogged her...
and embarrassed the sh*t outta her.

When the whole world is looking at you,

laughing at you,
calling you every name in the book,

do you know how hard that is?

That is 10 times harder to stay
in a situation than it is to leave.

We gotta give it to ourselves.

We are some strong... biatches.

We are.

We can deal with a lot,
and we should be proud.

I'm so proud.

- Completely different people.

- And I think you say that because...
- Ah.

- You become scarred, or...
- Oh.

- And then, like, you're trained.
- Like, there's trauma, so...

Yeah, you're trained to just
love people differently.

And, I mean, Kim found a guy
who's a great guy.

He's so sweet.

- Like, does so much. Like...
- Yeah, he's so sweet.

Picked us up
from the airport the other day,

like, had her... the coffee she wanted,

- had a coffee for me.
- Oh my god.

I didn't wanna tell him
it was completely wrong one.

He's just a, a great person.

That's so nice.

And, like, you can tell he cares
about people's feelings.

He was supposed
to come over here, actually.

Wonder where he is.

- Oh my gosh, are you and Pete besties?
- Mm-hm.

- Oh, good.
- Bunk beds, whole thing.

- Oh my god.
- We have the best time together.

- I'm happy that she has someone that's...
- But it's nice that...

- Nice to her, and, like...
- Right.

- Caters to her.
- Yeah.

Think she hasn't had that
in a really long time.

- No, but it's also just he makes her laugh.
- And...

- I, like... Everyone needs that.
- No, it's really cute.

She's so different, too, in front of him.

She, like, says, like, slang.
Like, young slang words...

- Oh my god.
- Like, she's like, "Yo, like, you [bleep]."

- I'm like, "What?"
- Oh my god.

Pete is so sweet.

I don't know him really, really well,

but from what I do know,
I think it's really drama-free.

It's really easy.

And I think that's something
that's the end goal.

Everyone wants that fairytale.
Everyone wants the happily ever after.

I think that's the hope...
Love shouldn't be this hard.

SCOTT: Oh, this is good.
[Khloé laughing]

Let me see a flip.

No, flips are dangerous.

Oh my gosh. You're going to, like...

This kid's a risk-taker.

- See that? That's an animal.
- Yeah, this is normal.

Yeah, Raymond!

- Yeah, Ray!
- Oh my god.

Yeah, Ray! Ooh, get that.
Raymond, Raymond, yeah! Raymond!

You got that?

Somebody?

Mom, Travis asked me if I would
marry him once a month for the next year.

- Oh, wow. Like, for real? I...
- You know, I can... - For real.

Actually, marry somebody legally.

Like, we just have
a celebration at weddings.

I never was that girl who had,
like, the vision of the wedding,

or thought about getting married.

We could do a wedding special.

We could even get Wolfgang Puck,

and mini crème brulées,
and cacio e pepe.

How do you spell cacio e pepe?

Sorry. I'm sorry.

I'm gonna pay attention
to you guys right now.

That was so much fun, you guys,

doing that song
in the studio and recording.

It wasn't work.

Everyone in my studio said that was
their favorite day at my studio as well,

by the way.
KRIS: Oh my god.

KOURTNEY: Really?
TRAVIS: That was so fun, yeah.

We have the final version
of "Jingle Bells"...

- You do?
- With, with the drums.

- Oh my god.
- Queue it up.

- Queue it up.
- And, of course, my jingle bells.

- Yes, please.
- So, this is the first time

- you're gonna hear...
- Woo!
