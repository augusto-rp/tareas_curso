I wait at the table and hold hands with weeping strangers
Wait for you to join the group
The tambourine jingle-jangles
The medium
Roams and rambles
Not taken in,
I break the circle
I want this man to go away now

With a kiss, I'd pass the key
And feel your tongue
Teasing and receiving
With your spit still on my lip — you hit the water


Him and I in the room
To prove you are with us too
He's using code that only you and I know
This is no trick of his
This is your magic
I'd catch the queues, watching you
Hoping you'd do something wrong
Everybody thinks you'll never make it —
But every time you escape,
Rosabel believe, not even Eternity —
Can hold Houdini
"Rosabel, believe!"


Through the glass, I'd watch you breathe
Not even eternity
Bound and drowned
And paler than you've ever been
Will hold Houdini
With your life the only thing in my mind —
We pull you from the water
Houdini...


You and I and Rosabel believe
