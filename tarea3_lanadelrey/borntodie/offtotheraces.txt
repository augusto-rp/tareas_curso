My old man is a bad man
But I can't deny the way he holds my hand
And he grabs me, he has me by my heart
He doesn't mind I have a Las Vegas past
He doesn't mind I have a L.A crass way about me
He loves with every beat of his cocaine heart

Swimming pool
Glimmering darling
Wipe bikini off with my red nail polish
Watch me in the swimming pool
Bright blue ripples, you
Sittin' sippin' on your black crystal, oh yeah

Light of my life, fire of my loins
Be a good baby, do what I want
Light of my life, fire of my loins
Gimme them gold coins
Gimme them coins

And I'm off to the races, cases
of Bacardi chasers,
Chasin' me all over town
Cause he knows I'm wasted, facin'
Time again on Rikers
Island and I won't get out

Because I'm crazy, baby
I need you to come here and save me
I'm your little scarlet, starlet
Singing in the garden,
Kiss me on my open mouth
Ready for you

My old man is, a tough man
But he got a soul as sweet as blood red jam
And he shows me, he knows me, every inch of my tar black soul
He doesn't mind I have a flat, broke-down life
In fact he says he thinks it's why he might like about me, admires me
The way I roll like a rolling stone

Likes to watch me in the glass room, bathroom
Chateau Marmont
Slippin' on my red dress, putting on my make up
Glass room, perfume, cognac, lilac
Fumes, says it feels like heaven to him

Light of his life, fire of his loins
Keep me forever, tell me you own me
Light of your life, fire of your loins
Tell me you own me, gimme them coins

And I'm off to the races, cases
of Bacardi chasers
Chasin' me all over town
Cause he knows I'm wasted, facin'
Time again on Rikers
Island and I won't get out

Because I'm crazy, baby
I need you to come here and save me
I'm your little scarlet, starlet
Singing in the garden,
Kiss me on my open mouth

Now I'm off to the races, laces
Leather on my waist is
Tight and I am falling down
I can see your face is, shameless
Cipriani's basement
Love you, but I'm going down

God I'm so crazy, baby
I'm sorry that I'm misbehaving
I'm your little harlot, starlet
Queen of Coney Island
Raising hell all over town
Sorry 'bout it

My old man is a thief, and
I'm gonna stay and pray with him 'til the end
But I trust in the decision of the Lord,
To watch over us
Take him when He may, if He may
I'm not afraid to say
That I'd die without him
Who else is gonna put up with me this way
I need you, I breathe you, I'll never leave you
They would rue the day, I was alone without you

You're lying with your gold chain on
Cigar hanging from your lips
I said "Hon' you never looked so beautiful
As you do now my man"

And we're off to the races, places
Ready, set, the gate is down
And now we're going in
To Las Vegas, pay us,
Casino Oasis,
Honey it is time to spin
Boy you're so crazy, baby
I love you forever
Not maybe
You are my one true love
You are my one true love

You are my one true love
