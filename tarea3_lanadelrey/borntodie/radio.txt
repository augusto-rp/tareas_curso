Not even they can stop me now
Boy I'd be flying overhead
Your heavy words can bring me down
Boy I've been raised from the dead

No one even knows how hard life was
I don't even think about it now because
I've finally found you
Now sing it to me

Now my life is sweet like cinnamon
Like a f*cking dream I'm living in
Baby love me cause I'm playing on the radio
(how do you like me now?)

Pick me up and take me like a vitamin
'Cause my body's sweet like sugar in the morning yeah
Baby love me cause I'm playing on the radio
(how do you like me now?)

American dream came true somehow
I swore I chase till I was dead
I heard the streets were paved with gold
That's what my father said

No one even knows what life was like
Now I'm in LA and it's paradise
I finally found you
Now sing it to me

Now my life is sweet like cinnamon
Like a f*cking dream I'm living in
Baby love me cause I'm playing on the radio
(how do you like me now?)

Pick me up and take me like vitamin
'Cause my body's sweet like sugar in the morning yeah
Baby love me cause I'm playing on the radio
(how do you like me now?)

On the radio, on the radio
Sweet like cinnamon
Like a f*cking dream I'm living in
Baby love me cause I'm playing on the radio
(how do you like me now?)
On the radio, on the radio
Sweet like cinnamon
Like a f*cking dream I'm living in
Finally found you
Now sing it to me

Now my life is sweet like cinnamon
Like a f-c-ing dream I'm living in
Baby love me cause I'm playing on the radio
(how do you like me now?)

Pick me up and take me like vitamin
'Cause my body's sweet like sugar in the morning yeah
Baby love me cause I'm playing on the radio
(how do you like me now?)

Now sing it to me

Now my life is sweet like cinnamon
Like a f*cking dream I'm living in
Baby love me cause I'm playing on the radio
(how do you like me now?)

Pick me up and take me like vitamin
'Cause my body's sweet like sugar in the morning yeah
Baby love me cause I'm playing on the radio
(how do you like me now?)
