Oh the river, oh the river,
It's running free.
And oh the joy, oh the joy
It brings to me.

But I know it'll have to drown me,
Before it can breathe easy.

And I've seen it in the flights of birds,
I've seen it in you.
The entrails of the animals,
The blood running through.

But in order to get to the heart,
I think sometimes you'll have to cut through.

But you can't…

We will carry…
You can't…
We will carry you there…
You can't…

Just keep following
The heartlines on your hand!
Just keep following
The heartlines on your hand!

Keep it up!
I know you can!
Just keep following
The heartlines on your hand!
'Cause I am…

Odyssey on odyssey
And land over land.
Creeping and crawling
Like the sea over sand.

Still I follow heartlines on your hand.

This fantasy, this fallacy,
This tumbling stone
Echoes of a city
That's long overgrown.

Your heart is the only place that I call home,
I cannot be returned.

You can…
(Keep it up)
You can…
You can…
I know you can…

Just keep following
The heartlines on your hand!
Just keep following
The heartlines on your hand!

Keep it up!
I know you can!
Just keep following
The heartlines on your hand!

What a thing to do…
What a thing to choose…
But know, in some way I'm there with you.
Up against the wall on a Wednesday afternoon.

Just keep following
The heartlines on your hand!
Just keep following
The heartlines on your hand!

Keep it up!
I know you can!
Just keep following
The heartlines on your hand!

'Cause I am.
