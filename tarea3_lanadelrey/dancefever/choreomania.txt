And I am freaking out in the middle of the street
With the complete conviction of someone who's never had anything actually really bad happen to them
But I am committed now to the feeling

I don't know how it started
Don't know how to stop it
Suddenly, I'm dancin'
To imaginary music

Something's coming, so out of breath
I just kept spinnin' and I danced myself to death
Something's coming, so out of breath
I just kept spinnin' and I danced myself to death

And this is the end
And I'm thinking about her
Driving around in the backseat of the car
I'll be your demon daddy
And do they speak to you?
'Cause they speak to me too
The pressure and the panic
You push your body through

Something's coming, so out of breath
I just kept spinnin' and I danced myself to death
Something's coming, so out of breath
I just kept spinnin' and I danced myself to death

You said that rock and roll is dead
But is that just because it has not been
Resurrected in your image?
Like if Jesus came back
But in a beautiful dress
And all the evangelicals were like
"Oh, yes"
"Oh, yes"

Something's coming, so out of breath
I just kept spinnin' and I danced myself to death
(Something's coming, something's coming)
Something's coming, so out of breath
I just kept spinnin' and I danced myself to death
(Something's coming, something's coming)
Something's coming, so out of breath
I just kept spinnin' and I danced myself to death
(Something's coming, something's coming)
Something's coming, so out of breath
I just kept spinnin' and I danced myself to death
(Something's coming, something's coming)
