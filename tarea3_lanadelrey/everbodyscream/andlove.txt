And love was not what I thought it was
It crept up on me despite myself
And it was not a love song, it was something else
More like surrendering to something
And more like resting than running

Peace is coming
Peace is coming
Peace is coming
Peace is coming

And love was not what I thought it was
More like an animal crawling deep into a cave
Than a romance novel heroine being swept away
More like surrendering to something
And more like resting than running

Peace is coming
Peace is coming
Peace is coming
Peace is coming

And love was not what I thought it was

(Peace is coming, peace is coming)
(Peace is coming, peace is coming)
