I wanna call you on the telephone
I made a thousand people love me, now I'm all alone
And my resolve is sinking like a stone
What would I even say? I guess it's something that just never goes away
A crowd of thousands came to see me, and you couldn't reply for three days

'Cause I'm stupid and I'm damaged, and you're a disaster
When you walk into the room, oh, none of it matters
Oh, baby, I just buckle my resolution in tatters
'Cause I know it won't work, but make it ache, make it hurt
Keep me a secret, choose someone else
I'm still hanging off the buckle on your belt
The buckle on your belt
The buckle on your belt
The buckle on your belt

Then you close the door and leave me screaming on the floor
Oh, baby, I just buckle, I can't take it anymore
Let you walk all over me, honey
You make me think my therapy is a waste of money
Drinking it down, haunting your city
Falling for anyone awful who tells me I'm pretty
I blocked your number, but you didn't notice
Oh, God, I thought I was too

Old for this
I should be over it
I'm much too old for this
But I'm not over it

'Cause I'm stupid and I'm damaged and you're a disaster
When you walk into the room, oh, none of it matters
Oh, baby, I just buckle my resolution in tatters
'Cause I know it won't work, but make it ache, make it hurt
I'm not better than this, show me what I'm worth
Keep me a secret, choose someone else
I'll still be here hanging off, I'm hanging off
The buckle on your belt
Buckle on your belt
Buckle on your belt
Buckle on your belt
