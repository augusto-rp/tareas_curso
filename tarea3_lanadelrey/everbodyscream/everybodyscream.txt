Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah

Get on the stage (Dance) and I call her (Sing) by her first name (Groove)
Try to stay away (Move) but I always meet (Shake) her back at this place (Scream)
She gives me everything (Love), I feel no pain
I break down, get up (No), do it all again
Because it's never enough (Live) and she makes me feel loved (Breathe)
I could come here (Go) and scream as loud as I want (Scream)

Everybody dance (Ah)
Everybody sing (Ah)
Everybody move (Ah)
Everybody scream

Here, I don't have to quiet
Here, I don't have to be kind
Extraordinary and normal all at the same time
But look at me run myself ragged
Blood on the stage
But how can I leave you when you're screaming my name?
Screaming my name

I will come to you in the evening, ragged and reeling
Shaking my gold like a tambourine
A bouquet of brambles, all twisted and tangled
I'll make you sing for me, I'll make you scream

Everybody dance (Ah)
Everybody sing (Ah)
Everybody move (Ah)
Everybody scream

Here, I can take up the whole of the sky
Unfurling, becoming my full size
And look at me burst through the ceiling
Aren't you so glad you came?
Breathless and begging and screaming my name
Screaming my name

Everybody jump
Everybody sing
Everybody move
Everybody scream
Everybody shake
Put down your screen
Everybody up
Everybody scream

The witchcraft, the medicine, the spells and the injections
The harvest, the needle protect me from evil
The magic and the misery, madness and the mystery
Oh, what has it done to me?
Everybody scream
