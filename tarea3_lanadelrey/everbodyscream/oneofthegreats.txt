I crawled up from under the earth
Broken nails and coughing dirt
Spitting out my songs so
You could sing along oh
And with each bedraggled breath I knew I came back from the dead
To show you how it's done
To show you what it takes to conquer and to crucify
To become one of the greats
One of the greats

I kept a scream inside my chest
Killed everyone I'd ever kissed
Hung them on the wall like trophies
Each name a stain upon my lips
I told the truth but could never see it through
You see yourself hung on the wall but that song is not about you
I wrote down all my fumbling visions transmitted by a television
Got everything I thought I wanted and cried hungover in a hotel closet
Did I get it right?
Do I win the prize?
Do you regret bringing me back to life?

Arms outstretched back from the dead
Streetlights bursting overhead
Arms outstretched back from the dead
Streetlights bursting overhead

I did my best, tried to impress, my childhood dream made flesh
And my dresses and my flowering sadness, so like a woman to profit from her madness

I was only beautiful under the lights
Only powerful there

Burned down at 36
Why did you dig me up for this?

Arms outstretched back from the dead
Streetlights bursting overhead
Arms outstretched back from the dead
Streetlights bursting overhead

You'll bury me again, you'll say it's all pretend
That I could never be great being held up against such male tastes
Because who really gets to be one of the greats, one of the greats
But I've really done it this time
This one is all mine
I'll be up there with the man and the 10 other women and
The 100 greatest records of all time
It must be nice to be a man and make boring music just because you can
Now don't get me wrong, I'm a fan, you're my second favourite front man
And you could have me if you weren't so afraid of me
It's funny how men don't find power very sexy
So this one's for the ladies
Do I drive you crazy?
Did I get it right?
Did I get it right?
Do I win the prize?
Do you regret bringing me back to life?
Did I get it right?
Do I win the prize?
Do you regret bringing me back to life?

Arms outstretched back from the dead
Streetlights bursting overhead
Arms outstretched back from the dead
Streetlights bursting

Too feminine to function
A pile of bodies and a trail of destruction

I will let the light in
I will let some love in
I will be happy
It will be perfect
I will let the light in
I will let some love in
I will be happy
It will be perfect
I will let the light in

Arms outstretched back from the dead
Streetlights bursting overhead
Arms outstretched back from the dead
Streetlights bursting overhead
Arms outstretched back from the dead
Streetlights bursting overhead
Arms outstretched
Arms outstretched

Streetlights bursting
Overhead
Overhead
Streetlights bursting
Overhead
