Through bramble and briar
Under ash and oak
I went to find the hidden folk
They gave me gowns and riches
Cut gold thread with their teeth
Every night I went to see them
No, I did not sleep
And every cup they brought to me
Oh, you know I dared

Drink deep
Drink deep

My eyes began to hollow
My skin began to fade
What I thought was a night was a thousand years
What I thought was a sip was a thousand tears
But still, they said

Drink deep
Drink deep

Like a thread that they spun
Was a woman's hair
And the gowns stitched from her tenderest flesh
And the cup that they brought
Up to my lips
I realised I drank of myself

Yes, it came from me
It was made from me, ah
Still I drank deep
Still I drank deep, ah

Oh-oh
Oh-oh
