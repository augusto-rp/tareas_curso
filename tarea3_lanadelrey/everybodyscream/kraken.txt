Sometimes my body seems so alien to me
I quiet it down by watching TV
Grow restless and grow hungry
As the water rises up around me
You come onscreen
So good-looking it's obscene
I put my fist into my mouth and scream
Some things, it seems, are catching up with me
And as it rises to my chin, I should really stop watching
And as I reach for the remote, it is rushing down my throat
I let it in, I start to swim
I grow many arms and legs and then I start to sing

And all of my peers, they had such potential
The swamp, it took them down
And my love, I have to tell you
I kissed them all and let them drown, oh
You didn't see me, just another drunken groupie
So when your hand reached out
I just pushed you further down
Well, do you see me now?

Ah,  (Do you see me?)

Ah, a (Do you see me now?)

Creature from the deep, do I haunt you in your sleep?
My tentacles so tender, as I caress your cheek
Did you know how big I would become?
And how much I would eat?
So glamorous and ravenous as I drag you off your feet
There's nothing you can do
Some things it seems are catching up with you

Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah (Do you see me?)
Ah-ah,

You said I would be nothing, but look, I'm really something
Many arms around the mast as your ship starts cracking
Will you see me through the pain?
Have you changed? Well, so have I
As I fix you in the gaze of my one unblinking eye
Do I terrify?

And all of my peers, they had such potential
The swamp, it took them down
And my love, I have to tell you
I kissed them all and let them drown, oh
You didn't see me, just another drunken groupie
So when your hand reached out
I just pushed you further down
Well, do you see me now?

(Do you see me?)

 (Do you see me now?)
ah (Do you see me?)

Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah (Do you see me now?)
h (Do you see me?)
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
 ah (Do you see me now?)
