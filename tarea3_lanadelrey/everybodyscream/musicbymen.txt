In every book in the house, notes from you fall out
All the love that came my way, I found a way to push away
I don't wanna be afraid anymore
I don't wanna run from love like I had before
And on the way to couples therapy, you put your headphones in
So you didn't have to talk to me
Listening to our own demos on the ride home
You have a bigger ego than you think you do
Slide down in my seat so as not to threaten you

Let it be us, let it be home
Falling asleep and not looking at our phone

'Cause I know how to fall in love, I do it constantly
I fall in love with everyone I meet for ten minutes at least
Then comes the work, the resentments, and the hurt
Picking at your haircut and that stupid band T-shirt

I always thought I was nice, I thought I was kind
'Til I tried to do something that was almost real life
It's not like what I've seen in TV shows
It's not like what I've read in books
It's so much harder than it looks
And there isn't much applause
If it required practice and dedication, I just got bored
We discussed something called compromise
A brand new concept that I never tried

Let it be us, let it be home
Falling asleep and not looking at our phone

'Cause I know how to fall in love, I do it easily
I fall in love with everyone I meet for ten minutes at least
Then comes the work, the resentments, and the hurt
Picking at your haircut and that stupid band T-shirt, hmm

Breaking my bones, getting four out of five
Listening to a song by The 1975
I thought, 'Fuck it, I might as well give music by men a try'

Let there be love, let there be light
Let there be a quiet day and an easy night
Let me put out a record and have it not ruin my life
Let it be us, let it be home
Let it not be a spotlight standing alone
Running back to the only love I could ever control
