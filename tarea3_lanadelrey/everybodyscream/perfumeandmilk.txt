Perfume and milk, the body in bloom
The falling leaves, the fallen fruit
The rot and the ruin, the earth and the worms
The seasons change, the world turns
Trees turn grey and the land turns brown
In a house in the woods on the edge of town
Bury it deep, swallow it down
Taking the herbs, a laurel crown
Doing the work and sleeping alone
Downloading "Revelations of Divine Love" on my phone
Trying to read, but getting distracted
Trying to live, but feeling so damaged

And all shall be well
All shall be well
Miracles are often inconvenient
And a prayer is a spell

I packed my bags and I got in the car
A pilgrimage to wherever you are
April comes with its blossoms beaten by rain
Oh, the hope and the horror, singing daffodils again
The land, it thaws and the leaves turn green
And the blue stars of snow glories with the winter jasmine
Clothes of silk and satin, lace and leather
The one pink ribbon that holds me together

And all shall be well
All shall be well
Miracles are often inconvenient
And a prayer is a spell

And I am changing, becoming something else
A creature of longing, tending only to myself
Licking my wounds, burrowing down
In a house in the woods on the edge of town
Well, healing is slow, it comes and it goes
A glimpse of the sun then a flurry of snow
The first green shoots in a sudden frost
Oh, something's gained when something's lost
The rot and the ruin, the earth and the worms
The seasons change, the world turns
The world turns

Perfume and milk, the body in bloom
The falling leaves, the fallen fruit
The rot and the ruin, the earth and the worms
The seasons change, the world turns
The world turns
The world turns
The world turns
