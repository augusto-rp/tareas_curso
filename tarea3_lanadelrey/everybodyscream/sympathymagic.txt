Memory fails me, names and faces blur
There is only after, or before
Am I so different? Have I changed?
I do not recognise my face
The scar fades but pulls inside
Tugging at me all the time
Chewing on a feeling and spitting it out
Crouched in a ball gown
Anxious and ashamed
The vague humiliations of fame

I do not find worthiness a virtue
I no longer try to be good
It didn't keep me safe
Like you told me that it would
So come on, tear me wide open
A terrible gift
Let the chorus console me
Sympathy magic

And light coming in the window just so
And the wind through my fingers
The only God that I know
And it does not want me on my knees to believe
Head high, arms wide
Aching, aching, aching

And alive
And alive
So I don't have to be worthy
I no longer try to be good
It didn't keep me safe
Like you told me that it would
So come on, tear me wide open
'Til I'm losing my mind
'Til I cannot contain it
La-da-da-da-da-da-da

So come on, come on, I can take it
Give me everything you got
What else? What else? What else? What else?
So come on, come on, I can take it
Give me everything you got
What else? What else? What else? What else?

Sympathy magic
Sympathy magic
So come on, come on, I can take it
Sympathy magic
Sympathy magic
So come on, come on, I can take it
(Come on, come on, come on, come on)
Sympathy magic (Come on, come on, come on, come on)
Sympathy magic (Come on)
Sympathy magic (Come on, come on, come on, come on)
Sympathy magic (Come on, come on, come on, come on)
Sympathy magic (Come on, come on, come on, come on)
Sympathy magic (Come on)
Ah
