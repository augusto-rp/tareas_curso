And the old religion humming in your veins
Some animal instinct starting up again
And I am wound so tightly, I hardly even breathe
You wonder why we're hungry for some kind of release
So tired of being careful, so tired of being still
Give me something I can crush, something I can kill

A lightning strike, a fallen tree
And I'm afraid, oh, don't let it find me
But you can't outrun yourself, you'll see
And I'm powerless, oh, don't remind me

And it's the old religion but the urge remains the same
Freedom from the body, freedom from the pain
And it's your troubled hero back for season six
When it's at its darkest, it's my favourite bit

And I am wound so tightly, I hardly even breathe
You wonder why we're hungry for some kind of release
Watch me crawl on hands and knees
And scratch at the door of heaven

A lightning strike, a fallen tree
And I'm afraid, oh, don't let it find me
But you can't outrun yourself, you'll see
And I'm powerless, I know, don't remind me

And it's the old religion humming in your veins
Some animal instinct starting up again
And I am wound so tightly, I hardly even breathe
You wonder why we're hungry for some kind of release

A lightning strike (And it's the old religion), a fallen tree
And I'm afraid, oh, don't let it find me
But you can't outrun (And it's the old religion) yourself, you'll see
And I'm powerless, oh, don't remind me
