I sit in the salt water, call in a vision of my daughter
Light a candle, place my grief upon the altar
Bird in my hands, a flower, a song
I used to think I knew what sadness was
I was wrong

A piece of flesh, a million pounds
Am I a woman now?
A crescent moon, an apple sliced
Thick in the sky
The air smells of fruit and smoke
The season is ripe
I stay in the house, move the furniture about
Try and control what I can
And feel the world slip through my hand

You can have it all
You can have it all

Dug a hole in the garden and buried a scream
And from it grew a bright red tree
Shining with jagged leaves
And when the wind blows, you can hear it
Dug a hole in the garden and buried a scream
And from it grew a bright red tree
Shining with jagged leaves
And when the wind blows, you can hear it

You can have it all
You can have it all

(You can have it all)
A piece of flesh, a million pounds
Am I a woman now?
(You can have it all)
Tree grows tall, can't cut me down
Am I a woman now?
