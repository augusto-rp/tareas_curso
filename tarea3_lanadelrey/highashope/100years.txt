I believe in you and in our hearts we know the truth, and
I believe in love and the darker it gets, the more I do
Try and fill us with your hate and we will shine a light
And the days will become endless and never, and never turn to night
And never, and never turn to night

Then it's just too much, I cannot get you close enough
A hundred arms, a hundred years, you can always find me here
And lord, don't let me break this, let me hold it lightly
Give me arms to pray with instead of ones that hold too tightly

We have no need to fight
We raise our voices and let our hearts take flight
Get higher than those planes can fly
Where the stars do not take sides

Then it's just too much, I cannot get you close enough
A hundred arms, a hundred years, you can always find me here
And lord, don't let me break this, let me hold it lightly
Give me arms to pray with instead of ones that hold too tightly

And then it's just too much, the streets, they still run with blood
A hundred arms, a hundred years, you can always find me here
And lord, don't let me break this, let me hold it lightly
Give me arms to pray with instead of ones that hold too tightly

I let him sleep, and as he does
My held breath fills the room with love
It hurts in ways I can't describe
My heart bends and breaks so many, many times
And is born again with each sunrise
And is born again with each sunrise

Funerals were held all over the city
The youth bleeding in the square
And women raged as old men fumbled and cried
We're sorry, we thought you didn't care, oh
And how does it feel now you've scratched that itch?
How does it feel?
Pulled out all your stitches
Hubris is a bitch

A hundred arms, a hundred years
A hundred arms, a hundred years

And then it's just too much, the streets, they still run with blood
A hundred arms, a hundred years, you can always find me here
And lord, don't let me break this, let me hold it lightly
Give me arms to pray with instead of ones that hold too tightly

Oh, oh, oh
