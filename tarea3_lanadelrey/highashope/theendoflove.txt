I feel nervous in a way that can't be named
I dreamt last night of a sign that read, "the end of love"
And I remember thinking
Even in my dreaming it was a good line for a song

We're a family pulled from a flood
You tore the floorboards up
And let the river rush in
Not wash away, wash away

We were reaching in the dark
That summer in New York
And it was so far to fall
But it didn't hurt at all
And let it wash away, wash away

And in a moment of joy and fury I threw myself
In the balcony like my grandmother so many years before me
I've always been in love with you
Could you tell it from the moment that I met you?

We're a family pulled from a flood
You tore the floorboards up
And let the river rush in
Not wash away, wash away

We were reaching in the dark (wash away)
That summer in New York (wash away)
And was it so far to fall (wash away)
Said it didn't hurt at all
And let it wash away, wash away

And Joshua came down from the mountain
With a tablet in his hands
Told me that he loved me, yeah
And then ghosted me again

We were reaching in the dark
That summer in New York
And it was so far to fall
But it didn't hurt at all
I let it wash away, wash away
Reaching in the dark (wash away)
That summer in New York (wash away)
And was it so far to fall (wash away)
Said it didn't hurt at all
And let it wash away, wash away
