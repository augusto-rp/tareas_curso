She knows that I've been doing something wrong
But she won't say anything
She thinks that I was with my friends yesterday
But she won't mind me lying
Mm, because

Mother stands for comfort
Mother, hide the murderer

It breaks the cage and fear escapes and takes possession
Just like a crowd rioting inside
Make me do this, make me do that, make me do this
Make me do that
Am I the cat that takes the bird?
To her the hunted, not the hunter

Mother stands for comfort
Mother, hide the murderer

Mother hides the madman
Mother will stay Mum
Mother stands for comfort
Mother will stay Mum
She stands for comfort
