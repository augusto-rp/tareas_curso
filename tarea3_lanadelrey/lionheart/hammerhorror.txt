You stood in the bell tower, now you're gone
So who knows all the sights of Notre Dame?

They've got the stars for the gallant hearts
I'm no replacement for your part
All I want to do is forget
You, friend

Hammer Horror, Hammer Horror
Won't leave it alone
The first time in my life, I keep the lights on
To ease my soul
Hammer Horror, Hammer Horror
Won't leave it alone

I don't know
Is this the right thing to do?

Rehearsing in your things, I feel guilty
And retracing all the scenes of your big hit

Oh, God, you needed the leading role
It wasn't me who made you go, though
All I want to do is forget
You, friend

Hammer Horror, Hammer Horror
Won't leave it alone, yeah
The first time in my life, I keep the lights on
To ease my soul (Ooh)
Hammer Horror, Hammer Horror
Won't leave it alone

I don't know
Is this the right thing to do?

Who calls me from the other side of the street?
And who taps me on the shoulder?
I turn around, but you're gone

I've got a hunch that you're following
To get your own back on me
All I want to do is forget
You, friend

Hammer Horror, Hammer Horror
Won't leave it alone, uh-uh
First time in my life, I keep the lights on
To ease my soul (Soul)
Hammer Horror, Hammer Horror
Won't leave it alone

Don't know
Is this the right thing to do?
