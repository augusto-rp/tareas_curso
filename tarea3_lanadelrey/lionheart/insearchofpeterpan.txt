It's been such a long week
So much crying
I no longer see a future
I've been told when I get older
That I'll understand it all
But I'm not sure if I want to

Running into her arms at the school gates
She whispers that I'm a poor kid
And Granny takes me on her knee
She tells me I'm too sensitive
She makes me sad
She makes me feel like an old man
She makes me feel like an old man

They took the game right out of it
They took the game right out of it
When I am a man
I will be an astronaut and find Peter Pan

Second star on the right (Second star)
Straight on till morning
Second star on the right (Second star)
Straight on till morning
Second star on the right (Second star)
Straight on till morning

Dennis loves to look in the mirror
He tells me that he is beautiful
So I look too, and what do I see?
My eyes are full, but my face is empty

He's got a photo of his hero
He keeps it under his pillow
But I've got a pin-up
From a newspaper of Peter Pan
I found it in a locket (I found it in a locket)
I hide it in my pocket

They took the game right out of it
They took the game right out of it
When I am a man
I will be an astronaut and find Peter Pan

Second star on the right (Second star)
Straight on till morning
Second star on the right (Second star)
Straight on till morning
Second star on the right (Second star)
Straight on till morning

When you wish upon a star
Makes no difference who you are
When you wish upon a star
Your dreams come true
