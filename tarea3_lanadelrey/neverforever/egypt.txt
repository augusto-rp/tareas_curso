Follow the Nile, deep to much deeper
The pyramids sound lonely tonight
The sands run red, in lands of the pharaohs
Their symmetry gets right inside me

I cannot stop to comfort them
I'm busy chasing up my demon
I cannot stop to comfort them
I'm busy chasing up my demon
Oh, I'm in love with Egypt

My pussy queen knows all my secrets
I'll never fall in love again
I drift with dunes, I whisper of the tombs
They offer me Egyptian delights

They've got me with that feline guise
Got me in those desert eyes
They've got me with that feline guise
Got me in those desert eyes
Oh, I'm in love
Oh, I'm in love
Oh, I'm in love with Egypt
