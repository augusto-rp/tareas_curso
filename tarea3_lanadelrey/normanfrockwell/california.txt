You don't ever have to be stronger than you really are
When you're lying in my arms
Baby, you don't ever have to
Go faster than your fastest pace or faster than my fastest cars

I shouldn't have done it but I read it in your letter
You said to a friend that you wish you were doing better
I wanted to reach out but I never said a thing

I shouldn't have done it but I read it in your letter
You said to a friend that you wish you were doing better
I wanted to call you but I didn't say a thing
(Two, three, four)

Ooh, I'll pick you up
If you come back to America, just hit me up
'Cause this is crazy love
I'll catch you on the flipside
If you come back to California
You should just hit me up
We'll do whatever you want, travel wherever, how far
We'll hit up all the old places
We'll have a party, we'll dance till dawn
I'll pick up all of your folks and all of your Rolling Stones
Your favorite liquor off the top-shelf
I'll throw a party, all night long

You don't ever have to be stronger than you really are
When you're lying in my arms
And honey, you don't ever have to act cooler than you think you should
You're brighter than the brightest stars

You're scared to win, scared to lose
I've heard the war was over if you really choose
The one in and around you
You hate the heat, you got the blues
You're changing like the weather, oh, that's so like you
The Santa Ana moves you
(Two, three, four)

Ooh, I'll pick you up
If you come back to America, just hit me up
'Cause this is crazy love
I'll catch you on the flipside
If you come back to California
You should just hit me up
We'll do whatever you want, travel wherever, how far
We'll hit up all the old places
We'll have a party, we dance till dawn
I'll pick up all of your folks and all of your Rolling Stones
Your favorite liquor off the top-shelf
I'll throw a party, all night long

Ooh, I'll pick you up
If you come back to America, just hit me up
'Cause this is crazy love
I'll catch you on the flipside
If you come back to California
You should just hit me up
