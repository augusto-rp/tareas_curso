John met me down at the boulevard
I cried on his shoulder 'cause life is hard
The waves came in over my head
What you been up to my baby?
I haven't seen you 'round here lately
All of the guys tell me lies but you don't
You just crack another beer
And pretend that you're still here

And this is how to disappear
This is how to disappear

Jim met me down at the training yard
Got cuts on his face 'cause he fought too hard
I know he's in over his head
But I love that man like nobody can
He moves mountains and turns them to ground again
And I watched the guys getting high as they fight
For the things that they hold dear
To forget the things they fear

And this is how they disappear
This is how they disappear

Well now, it's been years since I left New York
And I've got a kid and two cats in the yard
The California sun and the movie stars
And I watched the skies getting light as I write
As I think about those years
And I whisper in your ear

I'm always going to be right here
No one's going
Anywhere
I'm always going to be right here
No one's going
Anywhere
