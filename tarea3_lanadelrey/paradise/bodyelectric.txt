Elvis is my daddy, Marilyn's my mother,
Jesus is my bestest friend.
We don't need nobody, we got each other,
At least I pretend.

We get down every Friday night,
Dancin' and grindin' in the pale moonlight.
Grand all the prayer, feelin' alright,
She prays the rosary for my broken mind.

[Chorus:]
I sing the body electric,
I sing the body electric, baby.
I sing the body electric,
I sing the body electric,
Sing the body electric,
Sing the body electric.
I'm on fire, baby, I'm on fire.

Whitman is my daddy, Monaco's my mother,
Diamonds are my bestest friend.
Heaven is my baby, suicide's her father,
Opulence is the end.

We get down every Friday night,
Dancin' and grindin' in the pale moonlight.
Grand Ole Opry, feelin' alright,
She prays the rosary for my broken mind.

[Chorus:]
I sing the body electric,
I sing the body electric, baby.
I sing the body electric,
I sing the body electric,
Sing the body electric,
Sing the body electric.
I'm on fire, baby, I'm on fire.

My clothes still smell like you,
All the photographs say, that we're still young.
I pretend I'm not hurt,
I walk about the world like I'm havin' fun.
We get crazy every Friday night,
I drop it like it's hot in the pale moonlight.
And when I pray, I'm feelin' alright,
She's swayin' softly, to her heart's delight.

I sing the body electric,
I sing the body electric, baby.
I sing the body electric,
I sing the body electric,
Sing the body electric,
Sing the body electric.
I'm on fire, sugar, I'm on fire.
I sing the body electric, baby.
I sing the body electric, baby.
I sing the body electric, baby
