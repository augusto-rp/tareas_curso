My pussy tastes like Pepsi cola,
My eyes are wide like cherry pies.
I gots a taste for men who're older,
It's always been so it's no surprise.

Harvey's in the sky with diamonds and he's making me crazy (I come alive at night)
All he wants to do it party with his pretty baby.

Come on baby, let's ride
We can escape the great sunshine.
I know your wife and she wouldn't mind
We made it out to the other side [x3]
Come on, come on
Come on, come on, baby.

I fall asleep on an American flag
I wear my diamonds on skid row
I pledge allegiance to my dad
For teaching me everything he knows

Harvey's in the sky with diamonds and he's making me crazy (I come alive at night)
All he wants to do it party with his pretty baby

Come on baby, let's ride
We can escape the great sunshine.
I know your wife and she wouldn't mind
We made it out to the other side [x3]
Come on, come on
Come on, come on, baby
