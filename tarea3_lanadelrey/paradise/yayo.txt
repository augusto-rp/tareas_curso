I like the snake on your tattoo
I like the ivy and the ink blue
Yayo
Yeah, you
Yayo

You have to take me right now
From this dark trailer park life now
Yayo
How now
Yayo

Put me onto your black motorcycle
Fifty baby dollar dress for my "I do"
It'll only take two hours to Nevada
I wear your sparkle, you call me your mama

Let me put on a show for you, daddy
Let me put on a show
Let me put on a show for you, tiger
Let me put on a show

I need you like a baby when I hold you
Like a druggy, like I told you
Yayo
Yeah, you
Yayo

Put me onto your black motorcycle
Fifty baby dollar dress for my "I do"
It'll only take two hours to Nevada
I wear your sparkle, you call me your mama

Let me put on a show for you, daddy
Let me put on a show
Let me put on a show for you, tiger
Let me put on a show

Hello, heaven, you are tunnel-lined
With yellow lights on a dark night
Yayo
Yeah, you
Yayo

Put me onto your black motorcycle
Fifty baby dollar dress for my "I do"
It'll only take two hours to Nevada
I wear your sparkle, you call me your mama

Let me put on a show for you, daddy
Let me put on a show
Let me put on a show for you, tiger
Let me put on a show
