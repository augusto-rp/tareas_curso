After the party
You took me back to your parlour
A little nervous laughter
Locking the door
My stockings fall onto the floor
Desperate for more
Nobody else can share this
Here comes one and one makes one
The glorious union
Well, it could be love, or it could be just lust
But it will be fun
It will be wonderful

Oh, feel it, oh-oh, feel it, feel it, my love
Oh, feel it, oh-oh, feel it, feel it, my love
Oh, I need it, oh-oh, feel it, feel it, my love
Feel it
See what you're doing to me
See what you're doing to me

God, but you're beautiful, aren't you?
Feel your warm hand walking around
I won't pull away
My passion always wins, keep on a-moving in
So, keep on tuning in
Synchronize rhythm now

Oh, feel it, oh-oh, feel it, feel it, my love
Oh, feel it, oh-oh, feel it, feel it, my love
Oh, I need it, oh-oh, feel it, feel it, my love
Feel it
See what you're doing to me
See what you're doing to me
See what you're doing to me
