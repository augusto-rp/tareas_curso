You came out of the night
Wearing a mask in white colour
My eyes were shining
On the wine, and your aura
All in order
We move into the boudoir
But too soon
The morning has resumed

I'm hanging on the Old Goose Moon
You look like an angel
Sleeping it off at the station
Were you only passing through?
I'm dying for you just to touch me
And feel all the energy
Rushing right up at me
L'amour looks something like you

The thought of you sends me shivery
I'm dressed in lace, sailing down a black reverie
My heart is thrown to the pebbles and the boatmen
All the time I find I'm living in that evening
With that feeling of sticky love inside

I'm hanging on the Old Goose Moon
You look like an angel
Sleeping it off at the station
Were you only passing through?
I'm dying for you just to touch me
And feel all the energy
Rushing right up at me
L'amour looks something like you

L'amour looks something like you
L'amour looks something like you
