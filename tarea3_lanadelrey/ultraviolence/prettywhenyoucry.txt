All the pretty stars,
Shine for you, my love.
Am I that girl that you dream of?

All those little times,
You said that I'm your girl,
You make me feel like your whole world.

I'll wait for you, babe,
It's all I do, babe,
Don't come through, babe,
You never do.

'Cause I'm pretty when I cry.
I'm pretty when I cry.
I'm pretty when I cry.
I'm pretty when I cry.

All those special times,
I spent with you, my love,
It don't mean shit compared to all your drugs.

But I don't really mind;
I've got much more than that.
Like my memories, I don't need that.

I'll wait for you, babe,
Don't come though, babe,
You never do, babe,
That's just what you do.

'Cause I'm pretty when I cry.
I'm pretty when I cry.
I'm pretty when I cry.
I'm pretty when I cry.

Don't say you need me when,
You leave and you leave again.
I'm stronger than all my men,
Except for you.

Don't say you need me here,
You leave us, you're leaving,
And I can't do it, I can't do it,
But you do it well.

'Cause I'm pretty when I cry.
I'm pretty when I cry.
Pretty when I cry.
I'm pretty when I cry.

Pretty when I cry.
I'm pretty when I cry.
I'm pretty when I cry.
I'm pretty when I cry.
